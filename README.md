Aim: The Goal is to collaboratively create a simple shell that mimics the BASH shell. The Simple Shell will be called hsh.

What is SHELL?
A shell is special user program which provide an interface to user to use operating system services. Shell accept human readable commands from user and convert them into something which kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that execute commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. The shell gets started when the user logs in or start the terminal.
